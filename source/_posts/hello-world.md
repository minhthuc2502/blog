Welcome to my blog. This is the first post and i will share with you the overview about my career that i am pursuing - **embedded Linux software**. Before beginning my blog, i introduce a little bit about myself. I will graduate from INSA Centre Val de Loire (Institut National des sciences appliqu√©es), French in 2020. Now i live in paris and work for a company specialized in embedded system.

## Overview

As you know, the work for embedded system is devided into 2 main parts: *hardware* and *software*. There are several types of embedded software and they can be broadly classified into the following types:
- Embedded Bare-metal software
- Embedded Linux Software
- Embedded RTOS software

Now you can recognize that it is not easy to choose a job that suits your skill set :joy: . The reason i choose embedded Linux software because it is not deppend so much on architecture of the hardware. I think that anyone doesn't have the base of the electronic, the ability to read data sheets, working almost time with registers but want to work in this field, i would recommend embedded Linux as the best solution.

## Skills required

Not like Bare-metal, to work in embedded Linux software, you should have a strong skill and knowledge in programming with C/C++, architecture of software, architecture of Linux Kernel, Linux driver, file systems and also Operating System concepts like Scheduling, Queue, IPC (interprocess communication), Inter-thread communication... Maybe you can see there are many things to learn to start a job but among with my meager experience, i think if you have strong skill in programming and design of software, you can learn very quickly the other skills from the real projects. So don't worry :smile:.

## Missions

As a engineer in embedded Linux software, there are several missions for you during your career. Depend on your strengths and yours passion, you can work in different layers.
- The layer in low level is designing your own operating system to suit your particular needs and driver development for this operating system. Why we have to design a specified distribution Linux for each different device ? Because each device is designed with the size of different memory, so some device don't have enough ressource to run a big Linux image. Therefore, we need to determine clearly the needs for Linux system and design an operating system that contains only the composants needed. Some tools is used to build your own distribution like [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/), [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/).

- The layer in high level is developping the application in user space. It requires you to design the IHM (Human Machine Interface), develope application and apply the cyber security. This part need a strong skill in programming C or C++, IPC, Inter-thread communication, real time in Linux... This is also the most important part I want to pursue in my career.

## Conclusion

I hope that this blog can help you to understand more my job, the works and the requirements if you need to start a job as an embedded Linux software engineer. In the next time, i will presente more technically about the technologies used in this field. \
Take care of yourself :wink:
